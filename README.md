I am a Computer Science student at California State University - East Bay, where I am developing my skills in Python, JavaScript, SQL, and other programming languages and technologies. I am also a Student Assistant at the same university, where I support the faculty and staff with various tasks and projects related to computer science and information technology.

My goal is to become a full-stack software engineer who can design, develop, and deploy scalable and user-friendly applications for various domains and platforms. I am eager to learn new technologies and gain professional experience in software development. I have demonstrated my ability to work with web frameworks, such as React, Node.js, and Django, database management such as PostgreSQL and MongoDB, as well as cloud services, such as AWS. I am also a team player, a quick learner, and a problem-solver. I am looking forward to gaining professional experience and adding value to any organization that shares my vision and values.
